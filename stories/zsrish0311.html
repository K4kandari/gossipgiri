<h3 align="center">Rishabh meets Niharika</h3><br>
<h4>
Mujhe aaj bhi vo din acche se yaad hai jab mai Niharika se mila tha..<br>
vo Audit ka din tha aur koi bhi uske pass nahi baithna chah raha tha<br>
uss Samay mai aagey and i sat next to her.<br>
Uske Hontho pe laga lipstick aur 1 tone fairerfoundation uski cheapness define kar chukey the.<br>
She was very reserved,however as she was sitting next to a friend of mine and i was talking to him 
she spoke a little with Me and Akash<br>
ek do din shayad maine usko 'HI' kaha when i met her in the corridors and all<br>
So one fine day when we were sitting in 516 after our act had been cancelled, we were discussing what to do next...<br><br>
She gave her views regarding a lot of things that day and also i could sense that she was a very enthusiastic person 
cause she had already Participated in Dance and was managing both Performances<br><br>
<br>While we were practising i had a  doubt that this girl may not be able to act at all but she sent us an audio 
with the perfect voice we wanted and i was like 'This girl has talent'<br><br>
A few days passed into the practises we really got to know each other on whatsapp and she became more and more 'Easygoing'<br>
The day we had to perform Final practises, I saw her in a completely different avatar.<br><br>
The girl that was looking very reserved and Limited to herself and very Self conscious had now become 
a completely different person<br><br>
She would dance around,Sing,Laugh for minutes on the same jokes, Sit on the ground without worrying abt her dress..<br><br>
This is how i got to know one of the Most fun loving people out there<br>

<br><br>Moral - Ye poori pagal hai<br>
